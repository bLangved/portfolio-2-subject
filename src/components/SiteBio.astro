    <p class="bio-para">
      I have been working with sales, primarily sales of consumer electronics a
      big part of my life, but decided some years ago that I wanted to make a
      shift. I've been doing creative things since I was young, and wanted to
      work with something where I could express myself in new ways. This
      eventually led me into the path of programming languages.

      I have been playing videogames for as long as I can remember. With friends
      and by myself. I find the community to be highly social, and today,
      allmost everyone has some kind of experience or relation to this activity.
      It's a nice way to keep in touch with people you see rearly (or often!),
      and a great way to relax, and just have fun!
    </p>
    <p id="cookingPara">
      Since I was little, I allways found cooking fun. My mother has allways
      liked baking/cooking food, and I guess I picked up the interest from her.
      Though I may not be a chef, I allways found cooking relaxing, and it's a
      highly rewarding activity, since you can enjoy what you have been prepping
      in the kitchen afterwards! Food is also great to share with others, and a
      nice way to bring people together.
    </p>
    <p id="exercisePara">
      Even though it's something that comes and goes (at least for me), I find
      jogging, walking and small hiking sessions to be a really nice way to
      stress down. You also feel very good after a workout session, and it's
      nice for stimulating your brain, and helps you sleep better as well!
    </p>
    <p id="instrumentsPara">
      Since I became a teenager, I have been playing guitar. I picked up piano a
      few years after, and playing / creating music by myself or with others is
      something I really enjoy. It is one of the most important things I do
      every day to relax and collect my thoughts. I had more or less a break for
      a few years, but started up again, and it has yet again become something
      extremely important to me.
